<h1>KG's karaoke-video-player -- Brief User Guide</h1>

Update: 20220301

<h2>1. What this app can do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Records a video of your practice/performance 
with playing karaoke audio.</li>
<LI>Exports the recorded video and recorded karaoke audio to be downloades.
<li>Plays the mix of the recorded video and karaoke audio, then exports it.</li>
<li>(optionally) Records and exports desktop audio 
while playing YouTube video or whatever.</li>
<LI>may use external webcam, audio interface, mics
</uL>
<p>
This app runs on many web browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Safari and
hopefully on mobile version of those.</p>
<p>
Downloaded JavaScript app is cached and runs offline until it is deleted
from the web browsers cache.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>You cannot monitor your voice from headphones.
The captured sound from a mic is late by some 10 milliseconds and useless
for singing.
<li>More than one live audio inputs cannot be used at the same time 
by browsers capability limitation.
Then a karaoke audio file should be prepared before singing.
</ul>
You may use direct monitoring function of mic input by enabling 
so called "loop back" or "direct monitoring" on the device.

<hr>
<h2>2. Use cases (mainly about audio input)</h2>

Video camera: Built-in or USB webcam. Also wireless webcam may work.
<h3>A. Built-in speaker and mic</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pros: Simple and easy
<li>Cons: Karaoke sound from the speakers is recorded with vocal.
</ul>

<h3>B. Headset (mic + headphones)</h3>

Note: Headphones and built-in mic does not work for one hole jack
on a laptop PC. The built-in mic will be switched to headset mic.

<ul>
<li>Pros: Simple and easy. No bleed of karaoke to mic.
<li>Cons: Vocal may be too loud and distorted 
unless input gain is properly adjusted by device dependent way.
</ul>

<h3>C. External USB audio input and headphones/earphones</h3>

External USB audio includes USB microphone, USB audio interface, 
USB Webcam, etc. Wireless webcam may work with additional latency.
<ul>
<li>Pros: Best vocal sound quality. No bleed of karaoke to mic.
<li>Cons: Rather complex set up required.
</ul>
Audio output can be switched to an audio interface.
Most USB mic nor webcam do not have audio output.
